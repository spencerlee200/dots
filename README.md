  Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3 and good old fashioned Javascript

  The challenge for this project was to create a interactive game with full MVC architecture using only vanilla Javascript. I had a ton of fun with this and it definitely gave me the opportunity to fine tune my Javascript skills without being able to fall back on any kind of framework or external tool.
